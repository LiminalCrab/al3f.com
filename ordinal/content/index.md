## Introduction
This space is an archive of my [[creations]], the [[places]] I've been, and the [[experiences]] that have shaped me.

It's a home for reflections, creative experiments, and curated notes. Here, I collect fragments of thought, track ongoing projects, and preserve moments that might otherwise fade with time.

In keeping with the ethos of [[Merveilles]], the design of this space embraces a minimalism and accessibility. To uphold these principles, I have intentionally avoided JavaScript to ensure the site remains lightweight, fast, and functional across a wide range of devices and browsers. 

Instead, this space is generated by [[Ordinal]], a Python-based static site generator I developed. Ordinal processes content developed in Markdown, styles it with Dart SCSS, and uses Jinja2 templates to craft each HTML page. Ordinal is heavily inspired by Wikipedia, it emphasizes interconnected content where ideas naturally build on one another. 

## About Me
I'm Aleph, a multidisciplinary developer and creator driven by design, storytelling, andÂ interactive systems. My work spans software engineering, game development, and design.

In my professional life, I've worked in IT Operations and DevOps within large enterprise settings, building reliable systems in Python, orchestrating them with Ansible, and monitoring them with tools like Prometheus and Grafana. I've implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Bitbucket, managed containerized applications with Docker, Podman, and Openshift, and ensured system reliability through infrastructure as code practices with Puppet.

 I have also worked with much smaller organizations like [Evil-Algorithm](https://evil-algorithm.com/), a VFX company focused on designing immersive worlds, where I maintained web infrastructure and developed an asset pipeline to streamline workflows between various third-party tools.

Currently I am programming and designing for an undisclosed project with [Drednorzt](https://www.norzt.net/), under the team name "Creation", where we both learn and experiment with interactive media together.
