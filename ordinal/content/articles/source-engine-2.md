## Source Engine 2

This page serves as a gateway to all my notes and entries on Source Engine 2. While it's currently empty, it will soon contain insights, documentation, and observations about the engine, covering topics like level design, asset workflows, scripting, and modding.

## Why is this also a 404 page?
Until content is added, this page acts as a placeholder, essentially a 404 page within my wiki. If you arrived here expecting something more, it means I haven’t written about it yet (or I just haven’t linked the relevant entries properly). Check back later as I expand this section with detailed notes and references.
