## Emergence

This page serves as a portal to my writing on emergence, in games, software, design, and online communities. I'm particularly interested in how ecosystems evolve around simplicity and loosely defined rules that allow complexity to develop naturally. The best systems don’t dictate every outcome; they create a space where patterns form, adapt, and take on meaning through interaction.

To me, emergence isn’t just a feature of design—it’s a fundamental principle that underlies everything from procedural storytelling to decentralized social structures. A well-crafted system doesn’t enforce order; it enables it to emerge. In games, this happens when players build narratives around mechanics rather than following a script. In software, it’s how modular tools interact to form workflows greater than the sum of their parts. Online, it’s how communities shape their own identity through self-organization rather than top-down control.

## 404
Until content is added, this page acts as a placeholder, essentially a 404 page within my wiki. If you arrived here expecting something more, it means I haven’t written about it yet (or I just haven’t linked the relevant entries properly). Check back later as I expand this section with detailed notes and references.
