                <p>This website is a heavy work-in-progress as of 1/31/2025, It's still getting setup as of that date.</p>
                
                <p>This space is an archive of my <a href="/ordinal/public/articles/creations.html">creations</a>, the <a href="/ordinal/public/articles/places.html">places</a> I've been, and the experiences that have shaped me. It's a home for reflections, creative experiments, and curated notes. Here, I collect fragments of thought, track ongoing projects, and preserve moments that might otherwise fade with time.</p>
                
                <p>In keeping with the ethos of <a href="/ordinal/public/articles/merveilles.html">Merveilles</a><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1" class="footnote-ref">[^1]</a></a>, the design of this space embraces a minimalism and accessibility. To uphold these principles, I have intentionally avoided JavaScript to ensure the site remains lightweight, fast, and functional across a wide range of devices and browsers.</p>
                
                <p><h3 id="a-system-for-knowledge">A System for Knowledge</h3></p>
                
                <p>This space is generated by <a href="/ordinal/public/articles/ordinal.html">Ordinal</a><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2" class="footnote-ref">[^2]</a></a>, a custom-built static site generator written in Python. Ordinal processes content structured in Markdown, extracting metadata from frontmatter and transforming it into interconnected web pages. The system uses Jinja2 templates to dynamically render each page, ensuring a consistent structure while allowing for flexible layouts. Styling is handled with Dart SCSS, compiling stylesheets for an optimized, responsive design.</p>
                
                <p>I have spent years refining my approach to knowledge management. It started with Vimwiki, a simple plaintext system. As my notes grew, I moved through 11ty, Dendron, and other solutions, looking for something that could scale with the volume. None of them worked the way I wanted, so I built something that did.</p>
                
                <p>Ordinal is hypertext-first. Wikilinks resolve into bidirectional references, structuring information dynamically rather than imposing a fixed hierarchy<a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3" class="footnote-ref">[^3]</a></a>. Metadata enables categorization, sorting, and filtering. The result is an archive that functions more like a network of thought than a static list of pages.</p>
                
                <p>What started as a private repository has found its way here. Some entries are clean, others are rough, but they all exist because they serve a function. Happy exploring.</p>

                <p>I'm Aleph, a multidisciplinary developer exploring software engineering, game development, and design. I'm fascinated by <a href="/ordinal/public/articles/emergence.html">emergence</a>, both in how it unfolds within systems and how communities form, adapt, and grow as ecosystems around the creations within them.</p>
                
                <p>In my free time, I primarily work with Python and have built various tools, including <a href="https://github.com/LiminalCrab/auger" target="_blank">Auger</a>, an RSS feed aggregator for the <a href="https://github.com/XXIIVV/Webring/" target="_blank">Merveilles Webring Project</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/LiminalCrab/starlamp_base" target="_blank">Starlamp</a> which was a django based portfolio management tool. I’ve also explored C, developing projects like <a href="https://github.com/LiminalCrab/Apsis" target="_blank">Apsis</a> an attempt at a global metronome for networked music performances using SDL, and <a href="https://github.com/LiminalCrab/sidg64" target="_blank">Sidg64</a>, an early attempt at a Snowflake ID generator for PostgreSQL, which gave me experience working with libpq-fe. My first website, <a href="https://github.com/LiminalCrab/sudogami" target="_blank">sudogami</a>, was initially written in C, a fork of 100r.co's static site generator, but later migrated to the 11ty JavaScript framework as a static site generator.</p>
                
                <p>Currently, I’m working with <a href="https://www.norzt.net/" target="_blank">Drednorzt</a> on an undisclosed project under the team name <em>Creation</em>, where we experiment with interactive media. We originally started as a small team developing in the early development preview of <a href="https://sbox.game/" target="_blank">S&box</a>, working with <a href="/ordinal/public/articles/source-engine-2.html">Source Engine 2</a>. During this time, I gained experience creating 3D models in both Blender and Hammer 2, as well as designing textures in Substance Designer and Photoshop. We later transitioned to <a href="/ordinal/public/articles/unity.html">Unity</a> before ultimately settling on <a href="/ordinal/public/articles/unreal-engine.html">Unreal Engine</a>, where we continue our work today.</p>
                
                <p>In my professional life, I've worked in IT Operations and DevOps within large enterprise settings, building reliable systems in Python, orchestrating automation with Ansible, and monitoring infrastructure with Prometheus and Grafana. I’ve built and maintained CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and Bitbucket, deployed containerized applications using Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes, and enforced infrastructure-as-code practices with Puppet.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond enterprise work, I’ve contributed to smaller, experimental projects. I maintained web infrastructure and developed asset pipelines for <a href="https://evil-algorithm.com/" target="_blank">Evil-Algorithm</a>, a VFX studio founded by <a href="https://www.davidkarlak.com/" target="_blank">David Karlack</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3862741/" target="_blank">Leri Greer</a> focused on immersive world design. My role involved building workflows to streamline integration between third-party tools.</p>
                
                <p>My tools of the trade are as follows: I primarily use VS Code for programming, with Visual Studio when needed. For image editing, I use Affinity Photo as a replacement for Photoshop. Blender is my go-to for 3D modeling, and while I’ve used Substance Designer for texture creation, I prefer handcrafted textures over procedurally generated ones. For 2D vector art, I use Inkscape.</p>

                Merveilles is a community focused on minimalism, sustainable technology, and creative independence. Inspired by solarpunk, permacomputing, and the handmade web, it emphasizes building things that are lightweight, resilient, and accessible.

                Ordinal was built out of frustration with existing tools. Many static site generators either overcomplicated simple tasks or lacked essential features I needed. Writing my own gave me full control over how it structures content, handles metadata, and integrates with my workflow.

                The use of interlinks in Markdown is inspired by systems like TiddlyWiki and Obsidian. They allow for non-linear, interlinked writing, where ideas surface dynamically rather than being buried in a rigid folder structure.
