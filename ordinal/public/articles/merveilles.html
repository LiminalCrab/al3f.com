                <p>Merveilles is a decentralized collective of artists, programmers, and writers focused on self-sufficiency, minimal computing, and aesthetics-driven technology. It exists as a loosely connected network with members sharing a common interest in design, sustainability, and craftsmanship.</p>

                <p></figure></p>
                
                <p>The community thrives in text-based spaces—static sites, IRC, and the <a href="https://merveilles.town/home" target="_blank">fediverse</a>. Conversations focus on <a href="https://handmadecities.com/media/seattle-2022/complexity/" target="_blank">complexity in software</a>, <strong>sustainable practices</strong>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/weathering_software_winter.html" target="_blank">permacomputing</a> and <a href="https://100r.co/site/shining_sand.html" target="_blank">alternative methods of computing</a>. Members prefer to build their own tools rather than rely on commercial frameworks, choosing bespoke, handcrafted solutions that match their creative process and values.</p>
                
                <p>Merveilles favors plain text, minimal markup, and general hypertext-driven workflows, which keep systems practical, simple to maintain, and accessible. Many members create their own typographies and interfaces focused on readability and usability, which leads to design being as functional as it is ornamental.</p>

                <p>Aesthetics play a central role in Merveilles. Beyond software, creativity extends into music, physical crafts, and other hands-on disciplines, reinforcing a mindset that values making over consuming. Much of Merveilles' distinct visual style is described by <strong>Wiley Wiggins</strong>:</p>
                
                <p><blockquote><em>"The Merveilles visual aesthetic is defined by stark black-and-white palettes, minimalist geometric design, and a focus on resurrecting older hardware and software platforms. The sensibility connects to the past—it resurrects older hardware and software platforms and aesthetics and reconnects them to the present. Programming new art tools for vintage hardware and software is a common exercise. Livecoding is a defining art practice in the Merveilles sensibility, and exemplified in software projects like ORCA, Hydra, and Supercollider—open programming platforms where code is written and altered while it continues to run, creating music and live visuals algorithmically."</em></blockquote></p>

                <p>Merveilles values learning through creating, where the act of making is just as important as the result. Its philosophy extends beyond software into music, literature, and physical craftsmanship, emphasizing that building, experimenting, and refining are how we engage with and reshape the world around us. For members, creation isn’t just about producing finished works—it’s a continuous process of discovery and growth. <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/merveilles.html" target="_blank"><strong>Devine Lu Linvega</strong> describes Merveilles</a> as <em>“a collective of forward-thinking individuals who strive to better each other and their surroundings through constant creation and play.”</em></p>
                
                <p>In a time when technology is increasingly designed to generate, predict, and automate meaning on our behalf, Merveilles stands as a counterpoint—a space where creativity happens on its own terms, where human thought is reflected rather than replaced. The value isn’t just in what gets made, but in the act of making itself—experimenting, learning, and shaping something with intent.</p>
                
                <p><blockquote>The task that generative A.I. has been most successful at is lowering our expectations, both of the things we read and of ourselves when we write anything for others to read. It is a fundamentally dehumanizing technology because it treats us as less than what we are: creators and apprehenders of meaning. It reduces the amount of intention in the world.</blockquote></p>
                
                <p><cite>Ted Chiang, <em>Why A.I. Isn’t Going to Make Art</em></cite></p>
                
                <p>Merveilles is not about scale or recognition, but it persists regardless. Since its inception, it has remained a space for deliberate creation, choosing different ways to create and use technology all while advocating for digital spaces that are personal, expressive, and <em>deeply human</em>.</p>
