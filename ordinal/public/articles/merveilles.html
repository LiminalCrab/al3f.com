                <p>Merveilles is a decentralized collective of artists, programmers, and writers focused on self-sufficiency, minimal computing, and aesthetics-driven technology. It exists as a loose network rather than a formal organization, with members sharing a common philosophy of design, efficiency, and digital craftsmanship.</p>

                <p><img src="../images/merveilles_icon.jpg" alt="The flag of Merveilles."></p>

                <p></figure></p>
                
                <p>The community thrives in "text-based spaces", primarily through self-hosted platforms, static sites, and federated networks. Conversations revolve around low-tech software, sustainable practices, experimental interfaces, and alternative computing paradigms. Members build their own tools, often rejecting commercial frameworks in favor of bespoke, handcrafted systems.</p>
                
                <p>Merveilles emphasizes hypertext, semantic structure, and minimal markup, favoring static site generators, lightweight protocols, and screen-readable design over bloated</p>
                
                <p>web technologies. JavaScript is often avoided, and dependencies are kept to an absolute minimum. Personal wikis and plaintext journals serve as primary modes of publishing.</p>
                
                <p>Aesthetics are central. The community embraces a stark, high-contrast visual language, typically monochrome UIs, ASCII graphics, pixel art, and procedural design. Typography and layout are considered integral to functionality, with many members creating their own fonts, themes, and rendering engines.</p>
                
                <p>Merveilles rejects passive consumption in favor of active creation. Its philosophy extends beyond software into music, literature, and physical craftsmanship, encouraging a holistic approach to making. The goal is not only to build tools, but to rethink the relationship between technology and its users.</p>
                
                <p>Since its inception, Merveilles has remained an experiment in intentional computing, pushing back against the default assumptions of modern software and advocating for a future where digital environments are personal, expressive, and deeply human.</p>
