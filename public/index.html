                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This space is an archive of my [[creations]], the [[places]] I've been, and the [[experiences]] that
                    have shaped me.</p>
                <p>It's a home for reflections, creative experiments, and curated notes. Here, I collect fragments of
                    thought, track ongoing projects, and preserve moments that might otherwise fade with time.</p>
                <p>In keeping with the ethos of [[Merveilles]], the design of this space embraces a minimalism and
                    accessibility. To uphold these principles, I have intentionally avoided JavaScript to ensure the
                    site remains lightweight, fast, and functional across a wide range of devices and browsers.</p>
                <p>Instead, this space is generated by [[Ordinal]], a Python-based static site generator I developed.
                    Ordinal processes content developed in Markdown, styles it with Dart SCSS, and uses Jinja2 templates
                    to craft each HTML page. Ordinal is heavily inspired by Wikipedia, it emphasizes interconnected
                    content where ideas naturally build on one another.</p>
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Aleph, a multidisciplinary developer and creator driven by design, storytelling, andÂ interactive
                    systems. My work spans software engineering, game development, and design.</p>
                <p>In my professional life, I've worked in IT Operations and DevOps within large enterprise settings,
                    building reliable systems in Python, orchestrating them with Ansible, and monitoring them with tools
                    like Prometheus and Grafana. I've implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Bitbucket, managed
                    containerized applications with Docker, Podman, and Openshift, and ensured system reliability
                    through infrastructure as code practices with Puppet.</p>
                <p>I have also worked with much smaller organizations like <a
                        href="https://evil-algorithm.com/">Evil-Algorithm</a>, a VFX company focused on designing
                    immersive worlds, where I maintained web infrastructure and developed an asset pipeline to
                    streamline workflows between various third-party tools.</p>
                <p>Currently I am programming and designing for an undisclosed project with <a
                        href="https://www.norzt.net/">Drednorzt</a>, under the team name &quot;Creation&quot;, where we
                    both learn and experiment with interactive media together.</p>
                </p>
